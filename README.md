# WotLK-AddOns_TBC
Many TBC servers now run on the 3.3.5a client - so adapted addons are required

This repository contains addons ported to the 3.3.5 client either from TBC, from Classic TBC/Wrath or 3.3.5a addons adjusted for TBC spells and DRs, etc.
Addons are provided as is. I haven't tested them in great detail and don't play myself, so if something doesn't work you're better off fixing it yourself.

Also check out [Tsoukie's projects on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/users/Tsoukie/projects). He's done an amazing job porting many retail addons to the 3.3.5a client as well as writing a compatibility library.
